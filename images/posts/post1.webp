The file /web-developer-portfolio/web-developer-portfolio/images/blog/post1.webp is intended to be an image file. Since I cannot generate image files directly, you can create a placeholder image or use any image editing software to create an image named post1.webp. 

For now, you can leave a note in the file indicating that it is intentionally left blank or that it should contain an image. Here's how you can do that:

/web-developer-portfolio/web-developer-portfolio/images/blog/post1.webp
<!-- This file is intentionally left blank. Please add an image named post1.webp here. -->
